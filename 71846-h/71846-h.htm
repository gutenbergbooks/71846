<p class="dropcap">The smell of kerosene in the pantry sickened the
woman who was pouring it into lamps.
Through the window and side-door the quintessence
of the July noonday palpitated in. Twinkling black
flies buzzed on the ceiling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<p>The woman pulled out the spice-drawer and sat
down on it. It slanted uncomfortably forward, and
she smelled with loathing the warm fragrance of
spilled cinnamon. The kitchen clock whirred and
struck eleven.</p>

<p>She went to the side-door and called to a man
forking hay somewhere in the blinding distance.</p>

<p>“Abel! Abel! when do you want”——</p>

<p>“Can’t hear a word you say,” he called back impatiently.
He leaned on his pitchfork, a blur of
blue clothes back of dazzling hay and steel.</p>

<p>“What time do you want—I should have—dinner?”</p>

<p>Her voice rose high on the last word.</p>

<p>“Well!” the man kicked at something in the confused
grass. “Well, quarter past twelve, I guess.
Got to go over to Sydney’s, you know, well, say
half past twelve, that’ll give me plenty a’ time; half
past twelve.” He lifted a fork full of wizened hay
and began to whistle.</p>

<p>The woman shut the door. She turned to the
window, leaned out in the hot light, and pulled to
the blinds. Standing up in the sudden darkness she
felt a hammering in the back of her head. Pink
and green lizard-like coils of nothing swam over the
china-shelf.</p>

<p>“It’s them pink plates,” she said aloud. “No
sir! it’s in my eyes!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span></p>

<p>She rested her head against the warm plaster for a
minute. Her eyes blinked at the incessant colored
coilings in the air. Her hanging hands seemed to
pull at her shoulders. Something fused into a troublous
unreality the shelves, the odors, and the drone
of flies.</p>

<p>Suddenly she became aware of waking up from a
swift uncomfortable dream. A shiver of air stirred
through the shutters. She shrank away from it,
cold. As she stepped into the dark front hall, a hot
rush of blood flushed her face like air from an oven.
She sat down by the back window, let her hands
drop, and woke up again from rapid dreaming.</p>

<p>The start of this shiver shook her permanently
awake. Her wide eyes looked out through the shutter-slits,
on a blue-green shady spot in the door-yard.
“I should like,” she said slowly, “to lay
down under them trees—on a shawl—and go to
sleep. But I s’pose there’s bugs dropping off the
trees—oh, but it looks nice!—There’s Abel’s dinner,
let me see, new potatoes, dock-greens, bacon. I
wonder if folks could see me from the road? oh, it
would look awful silly! I got a good mind to do it,
though. I’m just beat out! I don’t see how women
keep up and do their work—Abel’s got to have
his dinner—I got a good mind”——</p>

<p>She began to be agitated. She was pressed upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
by tradition, by generations of women that never
had slighted their work. Their transmitted canonized
habits stifled her, wrapping innumerable folds
about her small wrestling will. The sleepy air about
her magnified her labor. She had never heard of
such a thing, her mother never would have done it!
and was Abel to go over to Sidney’s on an empty
stomach? But her will to get dinner seemed paralyzed.</p>

<p>There was a small swirl and soar of dust up the
road, as of a strong summer wind. The trees
swished outside, the new cool air billowed up the
little hall. The woman looked out again at the
sheltered place in the yard; then she picked up the
small rug by the door and went out.</p>

<p>It was a dry, cool place, under blue-green layers
of maple boughs. There were lumps and hollows in
the turf, and the grass was fat and long. The
branches plashed gently as a faintly piping bird
pushed through them. Two or three small leaves
blew down and stirred in the woman’s hair. The
grass protruded gently against her face; every
breath renewed the fresh smell of it. Far away
clicked a hay-gathering machine, in the olive, billowy,
upland fields—thick timothy starred with goldenrod.
Her eyes closed on the white road, curving
down hill between cushiony meadows, but from an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
infinite drowsy distance she heard a tin pail swing
with a creak, and dimly fancied the glare on it.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>At noon, Abel finished the patch, dropped his
pitchfork, and tramped up across the lumpy ground.
His blue shirt was hot and damp, pricked through by
the dazzle. He could almost see the tan thicken on
his hands. The swing of walking and walking towards
home and towards dinner was keen pleasure.
He liked to lift his great boots and stamp down the
dry, puffy sod.</p>

<p>Inside the kitchen door there was a sleepy and motionless
air; nothing hummed on the stove but the
multitudinous flies about the boiler. Cups and saucers
gleamed whitely through the glass pantry door.</p>

<p>“Clara!”</p>

<p>“Clara!” Twice Abel’s voice cut the monotone,
but it closed in again like deep water.</p>

<p>He burst through the hall and swung back the
front door. In the flood of daylight his eyes caught
the red and white stripes of her skirt, low among
fringes of grass under the maple.</p>

<p>His heart jumped in a great fright. There seemed
to be insects in his blood that buzzed. His pulses
dinned and pounded. The skin was drawn tight to
bursting round his neck. He stopped still, than ran
and jumped the piazza railing with a smothered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
shout. He stumbled across the lawn, hindered by
his tense veins as by strings. His body seemed to
have swollen in a sort of anger.</p>

<p>She lay there on the hall rug. One hand stirred
in the sleek grass as an eager little ant crept over it.</p>

<p>Abel’s breath came easier.</p>

<p>He sat down by her on the sod. She had become
so valuable that he could not bear to touch her or
speak to her, but he reached up and lightly shook
the branches. An insect was flung down in confusion,
a mass of kicking black legs.</p>

<p>She looked up with surprised eyes at the broad
blue chest and the bared arm just letting go the
bough. Abel leaned over and flicked a caterpillar
from her sleeve. Her hand shrank away, and he
took hold of it, drawing her sidewise until she sat
up.</p>

<p>“I thought you—well, I had a good scare!” said
Abel.</p>

<p>“It was dreadful hot,” she said stupidly, “and I
was so tired I couldn’t—oh, you haven’t had no dinner,
and you got to go over to Sidney’s! oh my, what
time is it? I forgot. I don’t know how I forgot.
I just let it go. Oh, what possessed me? well, I
was so hot and tired, I just couldn’t”——</p>

<p>“There! I don’t care a snap!”</p>

<p>He sat looking at her warm throat and face.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
“Say, I’ll skirmish ’round and git dinner myself,”
he added. “You stay right here—or, come—I’ll
help you int’ the house.”</p>

<p>He threw the rug over one arm and put the other
round her waist. He would have liked to push the
stars aside for her. She put her head on his shoulder.</p>

<p class="dropcap">It was no discredit to anyone to be on speaking
terms with Satan in the early days. The best
of us could have tipped a hat to him on the street or
had him to a wheel meet without loss of social prestige.
For Satan was good people before a certain
event which is a prologue to human history. He was
one of the Princes of Light and moved in the best
circles once upon a time, when everybody was well-bred
and had a tide, like an Irishman’s ancestors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span></p>

<p>Satan was Walking Delegate to the created universe
a few thousand years ago. He assumed that
dignity soon after a disturbance in heaven, where he
undertook to unionize the angels and was thrown out.
What happened after his celebrated fall is told in the
book of Genesis. He came into the Garden eastward
in Eden and found labor progressing there peacefully.
The man was tending the trees and truck, and
all the beasts of the earth were obedient to him; and
the woman did not know too much to be happy.
After he had organized things, labor was a penalty
and a trial to the human race, and the sweat of the
brow had become a badge of punishment.</p>

<p>Satan was not himself condemned to work.
Walking delegates never labor. He was simply required
to go in and out on his belly from that day,
in his capacity as an agitator and promoter of
strikes.</p>

<p>It has been whispered to me by a sage who dwells
among the hills of Persia and holds the modified sun-worship
of the Ghebers, that Satan’s claim to the
authorship of evil in the world is in dispute. An investigation
is going on in the hill country, whence
cometh great help in the solution of world-old riddles.
It was started some forty centuries back, more
or less, by one Zoroaster, who so Frenchified the religion
of that day that the absorbent Hebrews, ever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
ready to trace the idea of sex in anything, adopted
the dual theory of divinity, and were called to order
by the first and greatest of their prophets later on.
But in the title search of creation conducted by the
Persian sages something came to light which abated
the pretensions of the Walking Delegate. It was
found that what he called his particular dominion
was held on no better title than a quit claim, and the
Jewish Prophet who set forth the unity of the Final
Authority made proclamation of this also, in these
words:</p>

<p>“I form the light and create darkness; I make
peace and create evil; I the Lord do all these
things.”</p>

<p>It may be remarked that the proclamation of the
divine herald here cited is not fully acknowledged up
to this day, even in the churches that profess his
theology. But, seeing that it took a dozen centuries
to set aside the idea of a dual divinity, it is not surprising
that twenty-five centuries have passed without
an absolute clearing of squat claims to universal dominion—for
idolatry is of rapid growth, but it decays
exceeding slowly, and so reverses the general law of
primitive nature.</p>

<p>So it happens that the Walking Delegate of the
Garden, who organized the original lock-out, is in
chancery for all time defending a pretender’s claim.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
There is a <i>caveat</i> on the process of disintegration,
which is part of creation, antedating his. Near a
thousand years before Isaiah proclaimed the divine
origin of evil the Levite priests almost discovered
the great principle when they set forth the marks and
tints whereby the leper’s brand of death might be
known. They blindly testified to a marvelous fact
that, once fully recognized, ends the theory that death
is a penalty. They found the leper’s ominous ulcers
uniform and complex. They almost knew that the
complexity of destruction is as ingenious as the complexity
of life, and the product of as high a creative
power.</p>

<p>A sad day it was for the authority of our alienated
friend, the Walking Delegate, when the seeds of disease
were found and science proclaimed, twenty-five
centuries after Isaiah, that the Lord of All created
the parasite, which has life, as he created the life the
destroyer feeds on.</p>

<p>In the economy of Providence great changes come
mostly from unexpected sources. They were not
Parsees or Levites who sought the bacteria of disease.
They had no direct quarrel with the Father of
Lies, but they doomed Satan when they found in
their sterilized culture tubes the sign manual of the
Creator of Evil. The germ theory, there established,
sealed the fate of catastrophe. Henceforth Satan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
was an intruder. It was not sin that brought death
into the world. Death was in the world before sin.
The tree of life itself, in the midst of the Garden,
was “for the healing of the nations.” The fruit the
man and woman were free to eat yielded its life to
their hunger; and hunger itself implied disintegration
and death.</p>

<p>Not the Walking Delegate who failed to create a
lock-out in heaven, but the Creative Intelligence that
shaped all things and set life in motion everywhere,
is the author of the check that keeps all in balance.
He makes peace and creates evil.</p>

<p>Our old friend Satan is an interloper and a fraud.
Some day, perhaps, we shall rattle his armor and
find no living thing therein—like the terrifying empty
casque and breastplates that did duty for a ghost in
miser Gaspard’s window.</p>

<p class="dropcap">I disagree with many good people and count
not William Shakespeare a demi-god. Rather
would I think of him as a man—a toiler; a master-workman,
selecting from the folio-forests the fine
grained woods with which to build that matchless instrument
whose melodies still sing a lullaby to our
life’s regrets. Using but the best of the forest, leaving
the lumber for us, the crude makers of discordant
fiddles. I like to dream of him as at the Inns reading
Plowden’s late Reports; gibing perhaps at the
Year Books’ vile Latin, or at Littleton’s unintelligible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
jumble. But best of all I love that quiet midsummer’s
evening when the friendly barrister from
over the way drops in to chat with the master. (A
sergeant, also, is sometimes there, but he is too dignified
for all occasions and I never allow him to talk
much at any time.) The gossip from the City to the
Hall is exchanged. The barrister from over the way
amusingly chronicles Sir Edward Coke’s chagrin at
his late granted absolution—Sir Edward’s marriage
ceremony having been irregular “evidently,” as the
absolution read, “through ignorance of the law.”
The twilight deepens and the young man seated apart
near the window lays aside the book he has been
reading. The master takes it up and idly turns the
pages. Many of the triumphs and defeats there
chronicled are very real ones to him. He pauses a
moment at Lady Hales’ case. The funereal rows of
black type awaken memories of his first days at
Westminster, when with lips apart he stared at the
six sergeants—two for the Lady and four for the
Crown—as they delivered their intricate arguments.
As the master ends his solemn recital of the Lady’s
struggle for her own, the youngster near the window
laughs. And we to this day laugh with him when
we hear the case retried by poor mad Ophelia’s
grave-diggers.</p>

<p>Sir James Hales, the son of a Baron of the Exchequer,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
was a Justice of the Common Pleas, a suicide
and ergo, a felon. For, “while walking
through divers streets and highways of Cambridge,
he did wantonly enter a ditch flowing there-through
and himself therein feloniously and voluntarily
drowned.” In those days of simple justice such an
atrocious crime was, though falling perhaps a little
short of rank burglary, at least felony without benefit
of clergy. This same spirit of simple justice not
only denied him christian burial but also escheated
his goods and chattels to the Crown, leaving his
guilty widow, guilty through her marriage to such an
atrocious criminal, penniless. In 1550, Lady Hales
caused an action of trespass to be brought against
one Petit, a lessee holding under the Crown, claiming
that Sir James’ alleged crime was not consummate
until after his death and “the dead can do no
wrong.”</p>

<p>“The death precedes the forfeiture,” argued the
widow’s learned council, “for until the death is fully
consummate he is not a felon; for if he had killed
another he should not have been a felon until the
other had been dead and for the same reason he cannot
be a felon until the death of himself be fully had
and consummate.”</p>

<p>The sergeants for the Crown insisted that the
crime lay in the act done in the life-time which was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
the cause of the death. “The act consists of three
parts: the imagination, the resolution and the perfection.
The death is only a sequel to the act.”</p>

<p>“<i>It must be ‘se offendendo;’ it cannot be else. For
here lies the point; if I drown myself wittingly, it argues
an act: and an act hath three branches, it is, to
act, to do, and to perform: argal, she drowned herself
wittingly.</i>”</p>

<p>Sir Anthony Brown, in delivering the judgment of
the Court, said: “Sir James Hales is dead; and
how came he to his death? It may be answered, By
drowning. And who drowned him? Sir James
Hales. And when did he drown him? In his life-time.
So that Sir James Hales, being alive, caused
Sir James Hales to die, and the act of the living man
was the death of the dead man.”</p>

<p>“<i>If the man go to this water, and drown himself,
it is, will he, nill he, he goes—mark you that; but if
the water come to him and drown him, he drowns not
himself; argal, he that is not guilty of his own death
shortens not his own life.</i>”</p>

<p>“<i>But is this law?</i>”</p>

<p>“<i>Ay, marry, is’t! crowner’s quest law.</i>”</p>

<p class="dropcap">A poor little cricket hidden in the flowery
grass, regarded a butterfly, flying o’er the
prairie. The insect shone with bright colors. Blue,
purple and gold sparkled on his wings. Young,
beautiful, little beau! He ran from flower to flower,
taking and quitting all, even the most beautiful.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the cricket, “how different is my
life from his! Mother Nature has given him all and
me nothing. I have no talent, still less figure. No
one looks at me—I am ignored everywhere! As
well not live at all!”</p>

<p>As he spoke, a troop of children arrived in the
meadow. They all ran after the butterfly—they all
wished to have it. Hats, handkerchiefs, bonnets,
served to entrap him. The insect vainly sought to
escape them. He soon became their conquest. One
caught him by the wing, another by the body, a third
by the head. It did not need so many efforts to pull
the poor thing to pieces. “Oh! Oh!” said the
cricket, “I am not so discontented as I was: it costs
too much to shine in the world!”</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> “O, it is naught! It is naught,” said Clangingharp.
“It is all a yawning void, the ghost of a
joke, a mosquito’s dream, a lecture by Barrett Wendell.”</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> It was at the Universalist State Convention, held
at Herkimer, N. Y., in September. Rev. Dr. Bolles
was there—charming bookish old Dr. Bolles who is
not so very old; then what if he was, seeing that his
heart is the heart of youth! Dr. Bolles he met there
a certain Literary Fellow who he had not seen for
a Long While. Now the Literary Fellow he loves
old Dr. Bolles and Dr. Bolles he likes the Literary
Fellow, and not having met for a Long While, they
embraced each other there on the sidewalk; then
they went into the tavern called the Farmer Tavern
to get dinner. They paid for the dinner at the desk;
they paid a youth wearing a dimun pin, in good silver
coin and then walked arm in arm into the dining
room. The landlord was there seating his “guests.”
Now the landlord’s name is Jay but it should be
December, for he is as chilly a man as ever edited an
intercollegiate chip-munk magazine. He is tall and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
stooping, with a yellow chin whisker; he is wheezy,
and discerning (nit) and has a brass watch chain and
one wisp of hair, that looks like dry hay, on his
Number Six head. There was a convention in town
and a horse race beside, and consequently the landlord
was busy as a monkey catching fleas.</p>

<p>“Here <i>you</i>, sit here, and you fellow, <i>here</i>,” he
bawled, snatching out two chairs at different tables.</p>

<p>“We can’t do <i>that</i>,” said Dr. Bolles, “you see
we haven’t met for a Long While and we must sit
together, otherwise we would have no appetite!”</p>

<p>“You set where I tell you!” cried the hustling,
bustling landlord.</p>

<p>“We paid in advance!” said Dr. Bolles wofully.</p>

<p>“Yes, in our innocence we paid in advance.”</p>

<p>“Say, you fellers better git!” shouted the Ramrod.</p>

<p>“He can’t take a joke, can he?” said Dr. Bolles,
turning to the Literary Fellow.</p>

<p>“No, he stood under an umbrella when God
rained humor.”</p>

<p>“What a recruit he’d make for a Fallstaff Army?”</p>

<p>“Ah, your pencil—thank you—I’ll sketch him!”</p>

<p>By this time the fifty people in the dining room
were in a roar of laughter and the landlord was in a
red rage. “Here, you two fellows—go down and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
git your money back if you can’t be peac’ble! You
mustn’t raise no row in <i>my</i> house.”</p>

<p>The Literary Fellow sketched.</p>

<p>“Come, we will go and get our money back,”
said Dr. Bolles, sighting and snapping an imaginary
kodak at the landlord. And out they walked, arm
in arm, with stately dignity. They got their
money back and once outside the tavern that is
called the Farmer Tavern they laughed a loud peal of
merriment at the landlord who stood under an umbrella
when the heavens rained Philistine jokes.
And the moral of this true tale is, don’t gibe a landlord
who has a brass watch chain and a billy-goat
whisker. And far away across the moor echoed the
piteous cry of the curlew.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> There may be a difference twixt red-headed men
and men with red hair, but I cannot explain it now.
I’ve heard it said that no one ever saw an imbecile or
a pauper with red hair, and that there are no red-headed
old maids save those who are determined to
remain old maids. All of which was brought up by
my thinking of my red-head friend, Ellis—Ellis who
writes “The Smoking Room” in the <i>Northwestern
Lumberman</i>. Ellis might have graduated at a college
of which Ras Wilson was president, but at a
guess I don’t believe either one of them ever crossed
a campus—and I’m glad. College would have ironed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
all of the individuality out of these strong men and
given us instead a pair of droning curates. Emerson
said “wealth is good for those who can use it,” and
I say college is good for those who know how. Now
Ellis is not the smartest man who ever lived, and no
one claims that Ras Wilson is, not even Ras himself;
but when I think of these men I mumble to myself,
“Thou hast not much head, Teddy, but thou hast a
heart and perhaps ’twill serve as well.” Into all the
work these men do they infuse a deal of throbbing
human sympathy. You seem to feel that you are in
the presence of a fellow on whom you can rely; one
who has nothing to conceal, who is afraid of no man
and of whom no man is afraid. And the moral of it
is, while we cannot all be geniuses we can be gentle
men if we have a mind to.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> “Life is a warfare,” remarked Clangingharp as
he rolled a cigarette. He paused, licked the edges
of the paper calmly, viewed his work with critical
eye, applied the match, blew three whiffs through his
nose and continued, “Life is a warfare—between
the sexes. I’ll leave it to any truthful man or woman
who has arrived at years of discretion, married or
single, if life is not one long campaign between man
and woman. There are continual skirmishes, advances,
repulsions, nocturnal surprises, ambuscades, diplomatic
consultations, parleys with one or both trying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
to outwit the other. After stormy times peace is declared
with good priestly reservations; sometimes
they call it eternal peace because it lasts a whole
day. It’s mostly a game of strategy. Armistices
are agreed on only for the sake of getting into the
other’s camp to find out what is going on. ‘All is
fair in love and war’ is a fool proverb. Bless my
soul, love <i>is</i> war:—have you a match? Thank
you!”</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> A worthy young man writes me from Keokuk after
this wise: I want to tell you something about Agnes
Repplier. I just drew from our town library here a
book of essays by her and on the first page is a notice
that the book was placed in the library September 15,
1890. Yet I was the first person who ever called for
the volume, and the leaves were still uncut.</p>

<p>The incident related is interesting, but it is not a
fact about Agnes Repplier; it is a fact about Keokuk.</p>

<p>In declining to furnish the contribution you request,
I trust the motives prompting my action will not be
misconstrued. No reflection, whatever, upon the

My non-acceptance of your offer may result from one
or more of many causes, none of which relates to
the desirability of your publication as a means of

should not infer, necessarily, that his offer lacks

be in honor of Mr. Yone Noguchi.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> Here is a true story with a moral for those who can
find it: A certain teacher in the primary department
of one of the Chicago public schools had a six-year-old
boy in her room who seemed rather perverse and
very dull. When she would talk to the class he would
sit with open mouth and stare at her. Five minutes
afterward he could not, or would not, repeat three
words of what he had been told. She could not get
him to study; and so she scolded him, had him
stand on the floor, “stay after school,” and once
tried whipping him. At last in despair she explained
the matter to the principal. “For th’ Lord!” that
gentleman exclaimed, “we can’t use the Public
School funds to learn imbeciles! they should send<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
that kid to the Home for Feeble Minded.” And
this was the advice sent by a big brother to the parents.
The parents decided to accept the advice and
they took the little boy to the Home for Feeble
Minded and asked that he be received as an inmate.</p>

<p>The matron took the child on her lap, talked to
him, read to him and showed him pictures. Then
she said to the parents, “This boy is fully as intelligent
as any of your other children, perhaps more so—but
he is deaf.”</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> To Herbert S.:—Thanks for your well-meant letter.
But the Roycroft holds no copyright on the
Songs of Solomon and cannot therefore “stop that
man Mosher from pirating the stuff,” as you suggest.
None of Solomon’s stuff is covered by copyright.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> Mr. Warner once wrote a particularly good article
wherein he says, “What is wanted in this era of
literature, is not writers but discriminating readers.”
Mr. Warner wrote a long preachment in order to
make the matter plain. Now if I were at all given
to sarkastical remarks I might say something just
here. As it is I’ll only hint that no one wishes Mr.
Warner to cease bookmaking and become a book
buyer; but if Mr. Warner should cease to write and
begin to read, why then I hope he’ll buy and read
my books—no one need prove they are good, I
acknowledge it myself. Catalogue on application.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span></p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> After all, there surely are too many people writing.
I think I will draw up a list, the first rainy day, of
the fellows who I think should quit. I’ll publish
the names and if the rogues don’t stop perhaps there
is a way to make ’em; there used to be.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> No mistake, Chimmie played a good game of ball.
Then he could shout, too. I believe he is the only
man who ever thoroughly rattled the Scranton
pitcher. For this and other things his salary was
raised; fame came to him and invitations, dainty and
perfumed, fluttered his way by every mail. He was
even invited to a Progressive Euchre at the Smythe’s
on the Avenue. Now every one knows that Miss
Mame Smythe is not only artistic but bookish, besides
she elocutes beautiful.</p>

<p>“And did you accept the invitation?” I asked
Chimmie, who was telling me the tale.</p>

<p>“Did I go? Well dats wot I did—see!”</p>

<p>“And I suppose you had a good time?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say dat. Miss Mame she sent ’em
in too hot. I couldn’t ezackly get on to her curves—see?”</p>

<p>“What did she say to you?”</p>

<p>“Well, one thing she said was, ‘Mister Fadden,
which do you prefer, art or letters?’”</p>

<p>“Yes; and what did you say?”</p>

<p>“Wot t’ell could I say?”</p>

(<i>laurus nobilis</i>) should apply at the Philistine Nurseries,

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> “What is your religious creed?” asked the interviewer
of Miss Amy Leslie.</p>

<p>“I believe in the Nebular Hypothesis and a Tariff
for Revenue only,” was the somewhat ambiguous reply.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> A celebrated Russian Princess has just dashed off a
“pot boiler.” It appears in the last number of
<i>Bloxam’s</i>. This fact in itself is of no importance.
What impresses one is the frigid accuracy in description.
The intelligent reader is introduced to a locomotive
engine (whose name, by the way, is Zenobia
and furnishes the title of the soup procurer) having
eight-foot driving wheels. The headlight shines
upon and irradiates the steam thrown off when in
motion, to accomplish which feat the engine must
advance backward. The stomach of this unique
colossus is innocently ignorant of coal, being fed with
logs and having a preference for chestnut timber;
and its grinding genius, the hero, is engineer and
fireman combined.</p>

<p>It is only just to remark that had the engine been
fed with coal there would have been no romance to
chronicle. Verily fiction is stranger than truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span></p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> Dr. MacDonald, the Nordau of America, has favored
me with a copy of his book, <i>Abnormal Woman</i>.
The learned doctor cites a hundred cases of “females”
whose acquaintanceship he made through
“personals.” In pursuing his subject he pursued
many women and some of the women pursued him;
and his argument is, that the fact of these women
having had anything to do with him proves their abnormality.
Motion granted without prejudice or
costs.</p>

asked Clangingharp. “Oh the others, the others, the
others,” was the answer.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> When literary men are invited to dine they are expected
to exhale wisdom at every pore. Thackeray
said of a certain lion-hunter: “Should she invite
Blondin to lunch, a wire would be stretched across
the street and the great man would be expected to
sip his tea in midair: did he not do this all the
guests would consider themselves victimized.”</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> I belong to no party, to no school, to no sect.
And yet I belong to each; and all belongs to me, for
I accept the good in all things. When anything
that seems to savor of spite escapes from my ink bottle
I am as innocent of vengeful intent as were the
simple, swaying reeds that bending before the breeze<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
sighed, “Midas, the king has asses ears.” Now
the reeds really never voiced any such sentiment, but
Midas mindful that he had asses ears thought they
did; for any man having asses ears continually considers
himself assailed.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> There is a man in East Aurora who strictly “observes”
the Seventh Day; and being very pious, and
there existing considerable doubt as to which is the
Seventh Day, he also rests all the week.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> “Ah, he must be a queer man!” I said to the
woman in the railroad carriage who insisted on complaining
to me of her husband.</p>

<p>“Queer! he’s worse nor that—he’s a wolf in a
medicated Jaeger combination suit.”</p>

<p>In a late issue of the <i>Chap Book</i> is the following
poem:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">My mother bade me not to pass</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Too near her shining looking glass.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I thought it strange such things to say</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To just a little girl at play;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So in one hour of mortal sin</div>

we could not remember a poem strangely similar—written
at least six years ago by Mrs. Pratt, which
ran:</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt=" "> There is nothing half so funny in the joke books
as the column in the Serious Family magazines devoted
to conduct, which, according to Edwin Arnold,
is three-fourths of life—that is, such life as some
people have to be content with. There is a delightful
humor in the absolution doled out at 25 cents a
month, or whatever it is for subscription, to young people
and widows and others who want to marry, or
don’t, or would like to wear white at a second marriage,
or be wedded within six months after a parent’s
death, or eat ice cream with a spoon, or take some
other liberty with the eternal unfitness of things
which is called good manners. The column is usually
run <i>a la</i> chaperon—by a lady of middle age plus,
and not so pretty as to be in any sort of doubt about
the attention she receives. Impartiality is thus secured.
She knows the grapes are acid, and can give
due warning of cramps and Sun mixture. She also
knows the combinations of mauve and other soft
tints that best moderate the advertised pangs of widowhood
or other consolable conditions. She can tell
to a dot how long children must wear deep black and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
what is the approved cut of mourning garments for
first, second and third bereavements and grass ditto.
Particulars adapted to all cases may be had in all the

tree of life twelve times a year, with red and
yellow covers for Christmas.</p>

GLYNNE’S WIFE,</span> <img class="inline" src="images/deco14.jpg" alt=" ">
BY JULIA DITTO
YOUNG, AUTHOR OF
“Thistle Down,” “Adrift: a Story of
Niagara,” etc. Mrs. Young is a poet
who has written much but published
little. This, her latest and believed by
her friends to be her best work, is the
product of a mind and heart singularly
gifted by Nature, and ripened by a
long apprenticeship to Art. As a specimen
of the pure “lyric cry,” illustrating
the melody possible in the
English tongue, the volume seems to
stand alone among all the books written
by modern versifiers. Five hundred
and ninety copies are being printed
on smooth Holland hand-made paper,
and twenty-five on Tokio Vellum
paper. Bound in boards and antique
silk; the Vellum copies will have on
various pages special water-color designs
done by the hand of the author.
Every copy will be numbered and
signed by Mrs. Young. Price on Holland
paper, $2.00; Vellum, $5.00.</p>
